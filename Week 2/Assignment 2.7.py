## Exercise 7 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

# The following line prints out the character string 'Mary had a little lamb.' into the terminal.
print("Mary had a little lamb.")

# The following line prints out the character string 'Its fleece was white as' and then also prints out 'snow' due to the format at the end of the print command. The format replaces the braces in the print command.
print("Its fleece was white as {}.".format('snow'))

# The following prints out the character string 'And everywhere that Mary went.' into the terminal.
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")

# The following prints out 10 periods in a row in the terminal.
print("." * 10) # What'd that do?

# The following 12 lines are just creating 12 new variables called end with a number to make them different variables, and assigning a single character string to each one.
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch end = ' ' at the end. try removing it to see what happens
# The following prints out the respective end variables created above in order and uses the '+' symbol to string them together. The end=' ' is creating a space between the two print commands and strings the second print command to the same line.
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end=' ')

# The following prints the second half of the word by using the prior end variables created.
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)
