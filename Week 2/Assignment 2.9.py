## Exercise 9 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exactly.

# The following line of code is creating a new variable called "days" and assigning the following character string: "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun".
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# The following line of code is creating a new variable called "months" and assigning the following character string: "Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug". The \n is seen as a new line in this command so when it prints it would create new lines between each of the months.
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# The following line of code prints out the character string of "Here are the days: " and then lists the character string in the variable "days".
print("Here are the days: ", days)

# The following line of code prints out the character string of "Here are the months: " and then lists the character string in the variable "months", but it creates a new line and prints the next set of letters since we put \n in the variable assignment on line 13.
print("Here are the months: ", months)

# The following lines of code print out the following character strings exactly as they are on the lines they are in the print function. The triple quotation marks allow for free-type it seems and then are closed after the free type is done rather than putting quotes around each line.
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.

## Study Drills
# 1) Added the comments throughout the script as requested.
# 2) Found the error and fixed it. Noted it below.
# 3) Will do, and also will note them in the scripts below as I have been doing.
# 4) Will do.
# 5) Also, understand.

## Mistakes
# 1) I missed an "n" after the slash between May and Jun in months. I fixed this issue and noticed it right away when the print for months had two months on the same line. Again learning to be careful about missing characters.
