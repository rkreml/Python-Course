## Exercise 10 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

# The following code creates a new variable called "tabby_cat" and the assignment is a character string however it has the \t which is a horizontal tab function.
tabby_cat = "\tI'm tabbed in."

# The following code creates a new variable called "persian_cat" and the assignment is a character string however it has the \n which causes the string to be split into two lines.
persian_cat = "I'm split\non a line."

# The following code creates a new variable called "backlash_cat" and the assignment is a character string however it has the \\ which is a backslash so one prints into the terminal upon printing.
backlash_cat = "I'm \\ a \\ cat."

# The following code creates a new variable called "fat_cat" and the assignment is a character string however it has the triple quotation so it can do separate lines and it also utilizes the \t horizontal tab and uses the \n new line as well.
fat_cat = '''
I'll do a list:
\t* Cat food
\t* Fishies
\t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
'''

# The following code prints out the variable "tabby_cat".
print(tabby_cat)

# The following code prints out the variable "persian_cat".
print(persian_cat)

# The following code prints out the variable "backlash_cat".
print(backlash_cat)

# The following code prints out the variable "fat_cat".
print(fat_cat)

## Study Drills
# 1) I wrote them down in my notebook. I do not have flashcards.
# 2) Replaces the triple quotation marks with three '. It just looks cleaner and less confusing.
# 3) I have created a sample string below and printed it as requested.

test = '''
the following is
a test \nI
wonder what
this \v\b\bdoes.
Interesting!
'''

print(test)
