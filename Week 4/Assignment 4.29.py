## Exercise 29 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15

if people < cats:
    print("Too many cats! The world is doomed!")

if people > cats:
    print("Not many cats! The world is saved!")

if people < dogs:
    print("The world is drooled on!")

if people > dogs:
    print("The world is dry!")

dogs += 5

if people >= dogs:
    print("People are greater than or equal to dogs.")

if people <= dogs:
    print("People are less than or equal to dogs.")

if people == dogs:
    print("People are dogs.")

if people == cats and people == dogs:
    print("The world is in perfect balance.")

## Study Drills
# 1) It checks to see if the if logic statement gives a 'True' response. If that happens the code under the if statmenet is run.
# 2) Because it is part of that if logic statement, so it is kinda like a define.
# 3) It would break and nothing would happen if the if statement was correct. In this instance, the print function would always write no matter what as it is not requiring the if statement to be true.
# 4) I added an and statement.
# 5) Some of the statements would return false and not print possibly depending on what values we assign them.

## Mistakes
# 1) There were no mistakes in this script to my knowledge.
