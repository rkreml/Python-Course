## Study Drills
# 1) Because python is 0 index which means that years work out as the year doesnt roll over until after the prior year finishes. So python would recognize 2010 as being truly in year 2010 because 2,010 years have actually passed.
# 2) I am well aware of the lists and how they work in python.
# 3) Checked.


## Mistakes
# 1) No mistakes in this script to my knowledge.
