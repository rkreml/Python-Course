## Exercise 12 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")

## Study Drills
# 1) Looked at pydoc input as requested.
# 2) Used q to quit out of pydoc.
# 3) Looked online as requested to see that pydoc is used for documentation generation or is used for help.
# 4) Looked through the commands of pydoc requested. There was not anything interesting or unexpected. Typical information for open, file, OS (operating system), and sys (system).

## Mistakes
# 1) There were no mistakes in this script to my knowledge. I am trying to be more careful about copying the command scripts from the book without making typos.
