## Exercise 13 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

from sys import argv
# read the WYSS section for how to run this
script, first, second, third = argv

print("The first script is called:", script)
print("Your first variable is:", first)
print("Your second variable is:", second)
print("Your third variable is:", third)

## Study Drills
# 1) I removed one of the variables and got a traceback error. It expected four variables and only got 3. This makes sense due to me not putting all of the variables needed to run the script.
# 2) The two additional scripts are included. 'Assignment 3.13.a.py' and 'Assignment 3.13.b.py'.
# 3) The additional script is included. 'Assignment 3.13.c.py'.
# 4) Remembered. I have it noted down for future reference.

## Mistakes
# 1) No mistakes to my knowledge in this script.
