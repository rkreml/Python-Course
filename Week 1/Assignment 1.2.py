## Exercise 2 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

## Study Drills
# 1) I was correct about what the octothorp did in python from exercise 1.
# 2) I checked what I wrote and there were no mistakes from what was in the book.
# 3) I did not have any mistakes to fix.
# 4) Still did not have mistakes, but read it aloud anyways.

## Mistakes
# 1) None were made in this script.
