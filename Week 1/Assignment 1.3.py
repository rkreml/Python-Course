## Exercise 3 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

print("I will now count my chickens:") # This line just prints out a comment into the terminal.

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) # First part is a label for the math problem. Second part shows the amount by solving the equation.
print("Roosters", (100 - 25 * 3 % 4) / 1) # First part is the label for this math problem. Second part shows the amount of Roosters by solving the equation. Special notice of the Modulus which is in reference to the remainder of a division problem.

print("Now I will count the eggs:") # Prints the comment to terminal.

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) # Prints the answer to the equation. Again, special note of the Modulus.

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?") # It prints a question with the equation in it so the user can read what the equation behind the script is calculating.

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7) # Prints the answer to the equation above. Special note this is a logic question, so it will result in "False".

print("What is 3 + 2?", ((3 + 2) / 1)) # First part asks a question, second part of the line will result in the answer.
print("What is 5 + 7", (5 - 7) / 1) # First part asks the math question, second part of the line will result in the answer.

print("Oh, that's why it's False.") # Just printing a comment.

print("How about some more.") # Another printing of a comment.

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) # First part asks a question, but then second part is the equation it is asking about. Python will print the question and then will print the answer, in this case it will print "True".
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2) # First part asks the question, second part is the equation it is asking about. Special note about the greater than or equal sign. Pyhton will print the question and then the result of the equation, in this case "True".
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) # First part asks the question, second part is the equation. Special note of the less than or equal sign. Python will print the question and then the response. In this case it will print "False" as the result.

## Study Drills
# 1) I added the comments that explained what each of the script lines was doing.
# 2) I used python in the terminal as a calculator. I did some basic math and some order of operations problems.
# 3) I will attach this new python script file as "Assigment 1.3.b.py"
# 4) I added in dividing by 1 as to not change the answer, but it would cause the floating pointer to appear.

## Mistakes
# 1) I missed a comma in line 20, but I fixed it. I learned to make sure I add commas to separate out the text of a print and the actual code.
# 2) I put a ( in a spot where it should have been a ) in line 21. I fixed it. I learned to try to triple check when I put parentheses in code.
# 3) I accidently put a floating point for a logic question and it returned 0.0 which means False. I have corrected it so it now reads "False" again. I realized the error right away even if it did not give me an error because 0.0 was not usual. I knew it also meant "False".
# I learned to double check when I am editing a line of code.
