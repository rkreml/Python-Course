## Exercise 1 from LP3TH by Zed Shaw

print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun.")
print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print("This is an exta line for the study drill")

## Study Drills
# 1) I added in an extra line per request of the study drill. See line 14.
# 2) I made the script print only one of the lines and changed it back so all will print.
# 3) The octothorp is meant to comment out a line or future part of the line.

## Mistakes
# 1) There were no mistakes in this script.
